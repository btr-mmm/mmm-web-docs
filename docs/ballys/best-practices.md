# Content Best Practices

These practices will help to preserve user experience, SEO, and accessibility on the Bally's sites.

Currently, ADA compliance is equivalent to following the WCAG 2.1 AA standard. More info is available from [the W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). A WCAG checklist for every step of the design and development process is available [here](https://not-checklist.intopia.digital/).

## Repeated copy

## Images

I would like to move us away wherever possible from displaying text only in images, for several reasons:

- It is totally invisible to anyone using assistive devices.
- It contributes no value to page SEO (and, if improperly set up, may detract from it).
- It may become difficult to read on mobile screens without proper handling.
- Vizergy's responsive handling of images may lead to content getting cropped.

For compliance, any information in images _must_ be included in text on the page as well. To avoid redundancy for user experience purposes, I recommend avoiding text in images wherever possible.
