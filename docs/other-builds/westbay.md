# West Bay Community Action

This site is built on [Timber v2](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2), which is a theme platform that uses Twig template files. I recommend consulting that documentation whenever making template edits.

All pages have have ACF fields available.

The site's styles are in the default WordPress `style.css` file, and can be edited there.
